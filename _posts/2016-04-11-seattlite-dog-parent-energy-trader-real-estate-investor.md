Seattlite, dog parent, energy trader, real estate investor. 

Love all things water and wind. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8608ddb0-7947-49a8-8695-187973332ac2.jpg)

In the summer you'll find me around Lake Washington on my Sea Ray. Fall and Spring I'll be shredding that same lake in a Laser whenever the wind is 15+ knots.
